 <h1>  FROM TRASH TO TOYS, FOR SCIENCE</h1>
 “Toys from trash? Are you talking about some crafts class ? Sorry, but I am an engineer and don’t have time to make silly toys out of broken chairs and Styrofoam plates! And what , for heaven’s  sake can they do for science?” – If this is what you are thinking, just hold on and keep reading cause that man (our changemaker)  had quite a different opinion!
Arvind Gupta is his name.<br/> <br/><br/> If you had been watching the UGC programmes on Doordarshan you would definitely remember this Kadar clad lanky, broad headed and bearded person who has been showing to the rural children how to make experiments with so-called trash. While Education today has been limited to rote learning, Gupta shows how cardboard, matchsticks and straws can rekindle the long lost passion for ‘real’ science in young Indian minds.
It began in 1970s when he volunteered to teach the children of the mess staff, who couldn't afford a formal education (why haven’t we done it yet in our colleges?!). After graduating in 1975 from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, he went on to work at Tata Motors for 5 years. But this couldn’t satisfy his desire to improve this dead education system & help the poor gain access to learning. (How many of us dare change the system under which we suffer…most don’t move a step ahead of criticism!). In 1978, he took a one-year leave from his job, and took part in the Hoshangabad Science Teaching Program. 
There he ‘developed’ his idea of creating simple toys and educational experiments using locally available materials.<br/> <br/><br/> He says, “All teaching aids we use are hand-made. It‘s important for children to see that you don‘t need fancy materials. Science can also help you look critically at materials that are often considered trash, there is a lot of learning in that itself”. His first book, "Matchstick Models and other Science Experiments" was reprinted in 12 languages. 
30 years have gone by and Gupta has travelled to over 3000 schools, demonstrating captivating science experiments to wide eyed children. Today, he is part of the four-person team that runs the Children's Science Centre, at India's Pune University. On his website Gupta hosts thousands of books on science,  that are free to download. Many of which he has painstakingly translated to Hindi himself. There are books in over a dozen regional languages too. The site also boasts over 700 science projects with videos, pictures and instructions. More than 6000 books are downloaded each day!
Out of all of the toys, there are a few that have proven particularly popular. One of those is Matchstick Mecanno, in which little bits of rubber bicycle valve tube and matchsticks are used to make 2D and 3D shapes. Other favorites include the Simple Electric Motor and the Levitating Pencil, in which ring magnets are used to keep a spinning pencil floating in the air.
